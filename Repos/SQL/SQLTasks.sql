/* PART 2: SQLite
/* We now want you to jump over to a local instance of the database on your machine. 

Copy and paste the LocalSQLConnection.py script into an empty Jupyter notebook, and run it. 

Make sure that the SQLFiles folder containing thes files is in your working directory, and
that you haven't changed the name of the .db file from 'sqlite\db\pythonsqlite'.

You should see the output from the initial query 'SELECT * FROM FACILITIES'.

Complete the remaining tasks in the Jupyter interface. If you struggle, feel free to go back
to the PHPMyAdmin interface as and when you need to. 

You'll need to paste your query into value of the 'query1' variable and run the code block again to get an output.
